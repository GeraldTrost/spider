hints for table 'tasks'

- name each craling task like 'craw-xxxxx'
- site and url MUST NOT contain 'https://' or 'http://'
- site MUST NOT contain 'www.' 
- url SHOULD NOT contain 'www.'
- task names starting with '!' indicate not to crawl the site but only to grab data from a single url

hints for table 'selector'

- before defining a query selector in the slc field, test the selector in the browser's developer console!
- preface the slc with '=' (without blanks) to indicate that it returns one single line rather than an array of lines
- if the selector contains name and value then use ':=' inside the slc to seperate name and value
- within the slc you may use '{{*1..3*}}' to iterate it
--- e.g:  "=value:=getElementByTagName('li').items({{*1..3*}}).innerText" will evaluate items(1) and items(2) and items(3) 
- if the slc returns an array of lines then the naming option ':=' as shown above will be mandatory 

hints for table 'directive'

- for both, mining tasks ('grab = true') and crawling tasks ('grab = false'), define 
terms an url or html should contain or MUST NOT contain ('avoid') to be performed on a specific url.
